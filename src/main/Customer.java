//    It is worth stopping to think a bit about the last refactoring. Most refactorings reduce the amount
//    of code, but this one increases it. That's because Java 1.1 requires a lot of statements to set up a
//    summing loop. Even a simple summing loop with one line of code per element needs six lines of
//    support around it. It's an idiom that is obvious to any programmer but is a lot of lines all the same.
//    The other concern with this refactoring lies in performance. The old code executed the "while"
//    loop once, the new code executes it three times. A while loop that takes a long time might impair
//    performance. Many programmers would not do this refactoring simply for this reason. But note
//    the words if and might. Until I profile I cannot tell how much time is needed for the loop to
//    calculate or whether the loop is called often enough for it to affect the overall performance of the
//    system. Don't worry about this while refactoring. When you optimize you will have to worry about
//    it, but you will then be in a much better position to do something about it, and you will have more
//    options to optimize effectively (see the discussion on page 69).
